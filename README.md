# Megafy

### STATUS:

*Co-development of a Megafy webtool (w/ [Noah Do Rego](https://github.com/NoahdoRegoUO)) is underway to allow for simpler access to Megafy's functionality. The webtool is being made using React and Django (Python).*

### DESCRIPTION:

Megafy allows you to quickly customize audio files by:
- Bass boosting (use with soft clipping for distortion!)
- Altering audio speed (slowing or speeding up)
- Pitch shifting (lowering or raising pitch)
- Adding reverb
And more to come!
